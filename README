GBA-RUST
========

In order to learn more about the low-level aspects of rust, I
decided to implement some simple proof-of-concept games for the
gameboy advance in rust.

For now there is only a very simple implementation of snake.

To build, you need to have the rust compiler + some recent llvm
install in the PATH.
Since the rust compiler is still a moving target, a nightly build
around the time of the last commit is the safest bet, newer builds
might or might not work.

You also need to have binutils for the GBA at $ARM_TOOLS. These
can be downloaded from:

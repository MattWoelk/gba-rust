GBA-RUST
========

In order to learn more about the low-level aspects of rust, I
decided to implement some simple proof-of-concept games for the
gameboy advance in rust.

For now there is only a very simple implementation of snake.

To build, you need to install nightly rust + sources (probably using rustup.rs)
as well as [xargo](https://github.com/japaric/xargo).
The build has been tested with `rustc 1.15.0-nightly (ac635aa95 2016-11-18)`.

You also need arm-none-eabi binutils in your path. On linux you can
probably install those through your package manager.
